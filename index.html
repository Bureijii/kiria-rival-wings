                <p>
                    Both teams will have a North and South tower to protect their core. 
                    Each tower has a defensive field that will mitigate damage taken and heal you if you stand within its aura. 
                    Keep this in mind when being pushed against players on the opposing team. 
                    All alliances on your team gain Ceruleum and Soaring stacks when you destroy a tower.
                    Once a tower is destroyed the field disappears and the team's core becomes exposed allowing it to take damage from the opposing side.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="basic-objectives">
                <h1 id="basic-objectives" class="a-length">Basic Objectives</h1>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The first team to destroy the core located on the opponent’s base will be declared the winner.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the event neither team destroys a core, victory will be decided based on each team’s remaining core HP, 
                    number of towers, and tower HP, in that order. In the event these values are the same for both teams, the match 
                    will end in a draw. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Let’s cover the two main objectives to destroy in Hidden Gorge:
                </p>

                <h2 id="towers" class="a-length">Towers</h2>
                <div class="tower-images">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/red-tower.png">

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Both teams will have a North and South tower to protect their core. Each of your towers has a defensive field that will mitigate 
                    damage taken and heal you if you stand within its aura. Keep this in mind when being pushed against players on the opposing team.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All alliances on your team gain Ceruleum and <span id="soaring-icon"><strong>Soaring</strong></span> stacks when you destroy a tower. Once a tower is destroyed the defensive field 
                    disappears and the team’s core becomes exposed allowing it to take damage from the opposing side. 
                </p>

                <h2 id="the-core" class="a-length">The Core</h2>
                <div class="core-images">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/red-core.png">
                        <figcaption>Red Core</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Both teams will have a core located inside their base. The core cannot be damaged until at least one tower is destroyed. It is, however, 
                    ideal to destroy both of the opposing team’s towers first as any damage inflicted upon the core with a tower still up will be significantly mitigated.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="party-roles">
                <h1 id="party-roles" class="a-length">Party Roles</h1>
                <p>
                    There are four roles you should consider assigning in each party to maximize efficiency:
                </p>
                <h2 id="pilot" class="a-length">Pilot</h2>
                <p>
                    Pilots are in charge of mounting the machina for your party.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Try to pay close attention to the machina UI and map to see what your teammates/enemies have already mounted onto the field.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Machina usage is elaborated on <a href="#machina">here.</a>
                </p>

            <h2 id="ceruleum-collector" class="a-length">Ceruleum (CE) Collector</h2>
            <p>
                CE is required to get your party’s machina onto the battlefield. Machina are essential to winning games so having at least one person in a party collecting CE is important.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Keep your eye on the CE gauge to ensure that it is always at least 50 CE.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                You can gather CE in the following ways:
            </p>
            <h3>Gathering Ceruleum Tanks</h3>
            <p>
                Gather the glowing tanks that you see on the ground. You can find these under and around the train station at the middle of the map.

                Each one will add 10 CE to your party’s gauge. Once you have 50 CE your team can deploy a machina.
            </p>
            <h3>Mammets</h3>
            <p>
                Mammets are NPCs that will continuously spawn from both lanes from each side. They will only attack other mammets and will ignore players. While they can be healed, 
                friendly mammets have a 50% incoming heal penalty from players.

                Each enemy mammet kill can give your party up to a maximum of 20 CE based on how much damage you inflict upon it.

                If your team’s mammets reach an objective, such as a tower or core, it will self-destruct in order to damaging the objective.
            </p>
            <h2 id="laner" class="a-length">Laner</h2>
            <p>
                As a Laner your primary job is to push mammets and help escort your machina to the opposing teams objectives. Your job is also to defend against any advances from the 
                opposing team.
            </p>
            <h2 id="roamer" class="a-length">Roamer</h2>
            <p>
                As a roamer you will assist the CE Collector or Laner depending on the flow of the match. Your job is also to help capture side objectives like the trains or goblin mercenaries 
                throughout the entirety of the match.
            </p>
            </div>

            <div class="soaring-flying">
                <h1 id="soaring-flying" class="a-length"><span id="soaring-icon">Soaring</span> & <span id="flying-high-icon">Flying High</span></h1>
                <p>
                    <span id="soaring-icon"><strong>Soaring</strong></span> is an enhancing buff your party receives when defeating enemy players. Stacks are also increased for your party and all alliances when an enemy tower is destroyed. 
                    This buff can stack up to 20 times, increasing damage dealt and HP restored via healing spells/skills up to a maximum of 50%.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Upon reaching 20 stacks you will gain the <span id="flying-high-icon"><strong>Flying High</strong></span> status which will increase the rate which your Adrenaline gauge fills by 100%.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>The effects of <span id="soaring-icon">Soaring</span> and <span id="flying-high-icon">Flying High</span> are not applied when mounted in a machina.</strong>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="ceruleum-engines">
                <h1 id="ceruleum-engines" class="a-length">Ceruleum Engines</h1>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/ceruleum-engine.png">

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Throughout the entirety of the match, trains will arrive at the middle of the map carrying supplies that your team can claim. There is a timer on your UI counting down to 
                    the train’s arrival as well as a railroad crossing sound to signify the incoming train.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Be very cautious when crossing railroad tracks as getting run over will one shot you (even in a machina).</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to claim the supplies, you will need to occupy the station by standing next to the train when it arrives. Keep in mind you do not need to stand on the train itself. 
                    You only need to be standing within the highlighted zone to contest it. The train will release steam upon arrival so don’t jump on it right away or else you’ll be blown off.
                    <br>    
                    <br>
                    There is a gauge that will fill up overtime and will fill more quickly if you have more team members present than the opposing team. Standing near the train itself will give 
                    you a damage buff, so keep that in mind when fighting over the train.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One <span id="soaring-icon"><strong>Soaring</strong></span> stack will be awarded to every alliance upon successfully capturing a train.
                    <br>    
                    <br>
                    That being said, contesting the train isn’t always ideal. The supplies it has to offer at times aren’t worth the investment and you should use that time to capture other 
                    objectives. You can check to see what the train will offer before it arrives by checking the train UI.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The train offers four types of supplies:

                    your team is all full on CE you should still contest it to deny the other team from gaining it.

                    The team that manages to deal the most damage to him will form a contract where he will assist them in pushing the respective lane he was fought in. The mercenary in lane

                    skill is ineffective against mammets and structures.

                    All machina have this skill and it is used solely for the purpose of refilling EP which is essentially MP for machina. You should only ever use this skill if your machina 
                    is healthy or if you’re piloting a Brute Justice and need more EP.
                    <br>
                    Machina have no means of restoring hp so be mindful of this.

                <p>
                    Here are some strategies and tips that you may be able to implement to help give you an edge against the opposing team:
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The following map shows objectives and action ranges in addition to preferred spots for Oppressor to shoot missiles and be out of range of cannons, or certain locations 
                    that are suitable for knocking people away with <span id="steam-release-sm"><strong>Steam Release</strong></span>
                </p>
                <h2 id="mammet-rushing" class="a-length">Mammet Rushing</h2>
                <p>
                    This strategy is simple but can be extremely effective if left unattended by the other team. Decide with your team which lane you want to rush mammets with and destroy the 
                    objective as quickly as possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ideally, you want to push the lane where the mercenary will spawn in order to have a better chance of capturing him later.
                </p>
                <h2 id="oppressor-rushing" class="a-length">Oppressor Rushing</h2>
                <p>
                    This strategy involves everyone in the party to be a CE collector at the start of the game. Doing so allows the designated pilot player to mech up as an Oppressor as soon 
                    as possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ideally, you want to push out an Oppressor in less than two minutes into the game in an attempt to catch the opposing team off guard.
                </p>
                <h2 id="tower-holding" class="a-length">Tower Holding</h2>
                <p>
                    This strategy involves damaging a tower to extremely low hp and leaving it alone to destroy later. You’ll do this with both towers and ideally destroy both at the same time. 
                    This is to deny the opposing team access to piloting Brute Justice’s right away and allow your team to have momentum control.
                </p>
                <h2 id="gorge-sniping" class="a-length">Gorge Sniping</h2>
                <p>
                    This strategy involves landing missiles as an Oppressor from the center of the map. The angle and placement of the cursor varies depending on geography but this can be 
                    useful if the opposing team isn’t manning their cannons.

                <h2 id="blind-siding" class="a-length">Blind Siding Cannons</h2>
                <p>
                    You can avoid the cannons range by hugging the wall away from them in the safe areas as shown in our map above, or even with going beneath the cannon platform and dropping 
                    a missile. This can be extremely useful when trying to land missiles as an Oppressor on the enemy’s core.
                </p>
                <h2 id="cannon-sniping" class="a-length">Cannon Sniping</h2>
                <p>
                    This strategy involves rushing into the enemy’s base and killing the players mounted on the cannons to stop them from firing at your team.
                </p>
                <h2 id="geyser-hopping" class="a-length">Geyser Hopping</h2>
                <p>
                    The geysers that erupt near South lane can be used to hop into the lane to save you time from traveling all the way around.
                </p>
                <h2 id="map-it-out" class="a-length">Map It Out</h2>
                <p>
                    Try to keep your map open at all times. Objectives and machina are all marked so it provides vital information.
